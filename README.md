Detecting network attacks is a crucial pillar in protecting systems and data from increasingly sophisticated and diverse threats. The ability to identify and prevent attacks, or other forms of malicious activity, is a decisive factor between safety and risk in the modern connected environment. The process of network attack detection not only helps to safeguard the integrity and security of critical data but also provides the capability to timely thwart potential threats before they cause significant damage. Quick response in detecting and addressing cyberattacks not only keeps the system running smoothly but also minimizes risks and losses for the organization. Thanks to continuous monitoring and analysis of network data, attack detection becomes an essential part of a comprehensive information security strategy, ensuring the safety and stability of today's connected environment.

This topic on network attack detection will provide us with methods to detect attacks and understand how to prevent attacks on the systems we want to protect. In this topic, we will use the Suricata intrusion detection system, explore how Suricata works, its security features, and the log management challenge with the ELK stack
